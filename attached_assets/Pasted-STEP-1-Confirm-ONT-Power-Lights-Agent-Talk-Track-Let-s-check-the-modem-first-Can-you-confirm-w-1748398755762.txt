STEP 1: Confirm ONT Power & Lights
Agent Talk Track:
“Let’s check the modem first. Can you confirm what lights you see on your Nokia ONT box?”

No lights (completely dark) → Branch A

Red ALARM light → Branch B

Lights normal (Power solid green, data blinking green) → Branch C

Lights abnormal (blinking patterns, inconsistent lights) → Branch D

⚠️ BRANCH A – No Lights on ONT
Verify ONT is plugged into power outlet securely.

Try a different power outlet or different power cable (if available).

Still no lights after swapping power?
→ ONT likely defective: Schedule dispatch for hardware replacement.

Tip for Agent:
"If ONT shows no lights at all, it’s usually a hardware issue (failed power supply or unit). Quickly dispatch to resolve."

🚨 BRANCH B – Red ALARM on ONT
AltiPlano → IBN Provisioning → Troubleshooting:

If Rx levels blank (no signal detected) → Fiber break or outage.

AltiPlano → Alarm Analyzer: Input ONT ID:

If alarm: ONU Loss of PHY Layer, instruct customer to reboot ONT (unplug 10 sec).

Alarm returns after reboot?
→ Confirmed fiber issue → Dispatch fiber tech immediately.

Tip for Agent:
"Always reboot ONT once to confirm persistent fiber issue before dispatch."

🟢 BRANCH C – ONT Lights Normal
Agent Talk Track:
“The fiber modem looks good. Let’s check the router next.”

Check Eero router LED color/status:

Solid white: Go to Branch E

Blinking (blue, amber, or red): Go to Branch F

No lights on router: Verify power → Dispatch if dead router.

🔄 BRANCH D – ONT Lights Abnormal
If ONT lights behave unusually (random blinking, power cycling),

Perform full ONT reboot (30s unplug).

Still abnormal?
→ Possible defective ONT: Dispatch hardware tech to replace ONT.

🌐 BRANCH E – ONT & Router Both Normal Lights (Solid White Eero)
Agent Talk Track:
“Both devices appear online. Let’s verify your IP addressing next.”

AltiPlano → IBN Provisioning: Check customer’s WAN IP.

If CGNAT IP (100.64.x.x): Likely CGNAT issue → Escalate Tier 2

If valid IP (non-CGNAT), proceed:

Ask customer to test internet directly (plug laptop into ONT, bypassing router):

If internet works bypassing Eero → Faulty Eero router → Dispatch

If still no internet directly from ONT:

BroadHub → Disable/re-enable ONT to refresh IP.

Still no connection after refresh? → Escalate Tier 2 (Provisioning/Routing)

Tip for Agent:
"Testing directly via ONT helps isolate if router is causing issue. Always perform this step."

📡 BRANCH F – Router NOT Broadcasting (blinking lights on Eero)
Agent Talk Track:
“Your router seems stuck. Let’s power-cycle in the correct order.”

Correct power-cycle sequence:

Unplug both ONT and Eero Router.

Plug in ONT first → wait for green lights.

Plug in Eero → wait until solid white (up to 5 mins).

Still no solid white?

Connect laptop directly to ONT again:

If laptop gets IP & internet: Confirmed bad Eero → Dispatch

If no IP or internet via ONT: Go to BroadHub → disable/re-enable ONT

If no change, check for learned MAC/IP again in AltiPlano:

Learned MAC/IP present? → Faulty Eero → Dispatch

No MAC/IP → Provisioning or DHCP issue → Escalate Tier 2

Tip for Agent:
"A careful power-cycle order (ONT first) fixes router communication issues frequently."

🛑 CATCH-ALL SCENARIO – IF NONE OF ABOVE FIXES ISSUE:
Repeat full check carefully once more:

Re-check ONT lights and alarms.

Confirm fiber levels again.

Perform another bypass test.

Still unresolved after repeating steps?
→ Document carefully and Escalate Tier 2 immediately. Clearly detail steps already taken.

💡 Additional Tips for Agents (Include as expandable notes):
“No lights” usually indicates power/hardware issue.

“Red alarm” typically means fiber problem.

“Normal lights but no internet” = Router or provisioning/IP issue.

“Abnormal lights” = ONT hardware malfunction.

Always test internet by bypassing router to pinpoint router vs ONT issues.

🌟 Optional Advanced Feature (Future Add-On):
“Ask AI for Help” button at any branch, using GPT-4o API to suggest steps based on live issue descriptions and past solved cases stored in Supabase/Algolia database.

🚨 Final Escalation Notes (required if escalating):
Ensure the following info is included clearly:

ONT Model & current LED status

Router model & current LED status

AltiPlano Rx/Tx signal levels

WAN IP observed

Test results from bypassing Eero router

Every step completed clearly noted
