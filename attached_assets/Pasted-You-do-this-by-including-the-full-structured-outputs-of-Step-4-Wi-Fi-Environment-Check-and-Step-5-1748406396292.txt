You do this by including the full, structured outputs of Step 4 (Wi-Fi Environment Check) and Step 5 (Event Stream Analysis) in the same user message you send to the model. In practice you:

Capture all the variables from Step 4 and Step 5 in your app.

Serialize them into a single block of text (or JSON) and pass that as part of the user message.

Reference them explicitly in your system prompt so the model knows “use these details.”

Here’s a copy-and-paste-ready snippet you can hand to your Replit dev:

js
Copy
Edit
// 1. System prompt (defines behavior)
const systemMessage = {
  role: "system",
  content: `
You are VictorAI, a Tier-1 Wi-Fi troubleshooting assistant.  
Always use every detail provided about the customer's Wi-Fi environment and event stream to craft your 1–5 numbered steps.  
Do NOT invent or ignore any of the following data:  
- Wi-Fi environment variables (eero_only_wifi, other_wifi_devices, new_router, ssid_same_as_old)  
- Speed test results from customer device and Eero analytics  
- Event stream entries (e.g. 'iphone lost ip', channel utilizations)  

Use only Tier-1 actions (power-cycle, band adjustments, DNS change, guest network, legacy mode, extenders, signal checks).  
End with a “Talk Track:” and, if needed, “Escalate:” line.`
};

// 2. User prompt – inject step 4 & 5 details verbatim
const userMessage = {
  role: "user",
  content: `
Wi-Fi Environment Check:
  • eero_only_wifi: yes
  • other_wifi_devices: none
  • new_router: no_existing
  • ssid_same_as_old: yes

Speed Test Results:
  • Customer device (iPhone 14 Pro Max) on 2.4 GHz: 99 Mbps down / 20 Mbps up @ 2025-05-27T23:13
  • Eero analytics: 999 Mbps down / 989 Mbps up @ 2025-05-27T23:14

Event Stream Analysis (past 24 h):
  • iphone lost ip
  • channel_utilization_2_4: 55 %
  • channel_utilization_5: 21 %

Based on **all** of this data, give me up to 5 Tier-1 troubleshooting steps and a Talk Track.`

// 3. Call GPT-4o-mini
