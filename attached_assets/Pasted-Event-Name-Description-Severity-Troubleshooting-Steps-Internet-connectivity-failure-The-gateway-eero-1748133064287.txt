Event Name	Description	Severity	Troubleshooting Steps
Internet connectivity failure	The gateway eero has lost its upstream WAN connection (no internet).	Critical	1. In Altiplano/SMX, confirm ONT light levels & alarm codes.
2. Verify head-end hub provisioning.
3. Power-cycle ONT → wait 2 min → check.
4. If still down, roll truck.
Backup internet in use	Your network has automatically switched to the configured backup source (e.g. mobile hotspot).	Info	1. Confirm backup source (hotspot or secondary AP) is reachable & has good signal.
2. When primary WAN returns, verify it fails back automatically.
3. If it doesn’t, reboot gateway eero and re-test primary.
Channel switch detected	The eero has changed Wi-Fi channel (2.4 GHz or 5 GHz) – usually to avoid interference.	Info	1. In Insight ▶ Network ▶ select band ▶ check Channel Utilization.
2. If utilization > 80 %, consider manually assigning a less-crowded channel in eeroOS.
3. Retest client performance.
DFS strike detected	A radar interference (“DFS strike”) forced the eero to vacate its channel and move to a new DFS-approved channel.	Warning	1. Allow 1–2 min for automatic channel re-selection.
2. If strikes repeat, relocate the eero away from the source of radar interference (windows/airfield).
3. Advise limiting use of DFS channels via band settings if your region allows.
Ethernet port carrier status changed	A wired link went down or came back up on one of the eero’s Ethernet ports.	Warning	1. Check the physical cable & connectors.
2. Swap to a different port and/or cable.
3. Test with a known-good device.
4. If flapping continues, replace cable or escalate for hardware swap.

Changed Ethernet port X speed to Y	The negotiated link speed on an Ethernet port has changed (e.g. “…changed Ethernet port 2 speed to 100 Mbps”).	Info	1. Verify cable rating (Cat 5e+ for ≥ 1 Gbps).
2. Test device NIC for Gigabit support.
3. If mismatch persists, swap port/cable or escalate for further diagnostics.

Gateway-to-leaf link signal changed	The backhaul signal strength between your gateway and a leaf (extender) has fluctuated outside normal parameters.	Warning	1. In Insight ▶ Topology, hover over the link to view RSSI.
2. Ensure nodes are within recommended range (30–60 ft indoors) with minimal obstructions.
3. Reposition leaf or add another extender if signal < –65 dBm.
Gateway-to-leaf path changed	The mesh routing path has shifted (e.g. a leaf node re-associated to a different gateway or intermediate leaf for better performance).	Info	1. In Insight ▶ Topology, confirm the new path is optimal (shortest hop, strongest RSSI).
2. If an unexpected hop appears (e.g. leaf → leaf → gateway), consider moving that leaf closer to the gateway or adjusting placement to restore a direct link.
