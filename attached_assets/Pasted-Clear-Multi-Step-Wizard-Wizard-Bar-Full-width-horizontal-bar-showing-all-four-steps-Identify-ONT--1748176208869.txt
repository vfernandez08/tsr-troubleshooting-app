Case TSR-20250525-ADC47B17 – In Progress | Step 1 of 4: Equipment Identification
Clickable Steps
Allow agents to click completed steps to jump back if needed.

2. Remove Manual ONT-ID Field
Omit the “ONT ID (approximately 12 digits)” input entirely.

No BroadHub API integration yet—agents will still look it up externally, but it won’t live in the form.

Retire the bottom “Tip” box related to ONT ID.

3. Form Layout & Field Styling
Card Containers
Each step (“Equipment Identification”, “Router Selection”, etc.) lives in its own rounded-corner card with subtle shadow.

Labels Above Inputs
Field labels sit above inputs in medium-weight text (never placeholders only).

Real-Time Validation
Validate required fields on blur; disable “Continue” until they all pass.

Keyboard-First Navigation
• Auto-focus the first empty field on load
• Allow Enter/Ctrl+Enter to advance

4. Primary Call-to-Action
Button Styling
Full-width solid brand-blue for “Continue to Router Selection.”
• Darken slightly on hover
• On click, change to “Loading router list…” with a spinner

Sticky Footer
Move “View Summary” and “Back to Home” into a footer that stays visible.

5. Contextual Help & Tooltips
Inline Tooltip
Swap the light-blue info box for a tooltip icon on the card header (“Equipment Identification ⓘ”).

Step-Specific Guidance
Update help text per step—no generic tip box at the bottom.

6. Side-Panel Optimization
Collapsible Sections
Agents can collapse “Customer Information” or “Equipment Information” once read.

Visual Hierarchy
Darker panel headers; two-column label/value grid with clear weight differences.

Status Badges
“Not entered” → neutral grey pill. Once populated, show the value in a green pill.

7. Autosave & Session Recovery
Auto-Save Drafts
Persist form state in local storage (or backend) so nothing’s lost on refresh.

Last-Saved Stamp
Display “Last saved at HH:MM AM/PM” in the footer.

8. Responsive & Accessibility
Mobile/Tablet
Collapse side panels under the main card; pin the Continue button at screen bottom.

ARIA & Contrast
Ensure labels/inputs/buttons meet WCAG AA contrast and include proper ARIA attributes.

9. Clean Report Generation (Step 4)
After diagnostics, auto-compile a Summary Report showing:

Customer & equipment details

Steps performed & results

Final status and next-step recommendations

Present it as a copy-ready text/HTML snippet under “View Summary” that agents can paste directly into Teams or tickets.

Include a “Copy to Clipboard” button for one-click sharing.
