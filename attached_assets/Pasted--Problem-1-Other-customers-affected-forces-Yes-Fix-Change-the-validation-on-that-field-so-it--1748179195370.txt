✅ Problem 1: “Other customers affected” forces Yes
➤ Fix:
Change the validation on that field so it accepts both Yes and No as valid entries. Right now it may be set as required without an actual radio input or dropdown validation.

Instruction for Replit Agent:

In the Dispatch Approval Form schema or template (likely templates/dispatch_form.html or routes.py), update the other_customers_affected field:

html
Copy
Edit
<label>Other Customers Affected? *</label>
<select name="other_customers_affected" required>
  <option value="" disabled selected>Select one</option>
  <option value="Yes">Yes</option>
  <option value="No">No</option>
</select>
✅ Accept both values. ❌ Don’t default it to "Yes" or require "Yes" to proceed.

✅ Problem 2: It ends with “Escalate to Tier 2”
➤ Fix:
Skip Tier 2. Instead, automatically generate a clean case summary for field dispatch to paste into Teams.

Instruction for Replit Agent:

🔧 When the user clicks Submit & Resolve on the Dispatch Approval step:

Instead of showing “Escalate to Tier 2”, generate a formatted report string from all submitted data.

Display it on a final confirmation page in a code-friendly block (<textarea readonly> or similar).

Include a “Copy to Clipboard” button for easy posting in Teams.

✨ Format for the Teams Summary Output
Here’s how the report should look when outputted by the app:
