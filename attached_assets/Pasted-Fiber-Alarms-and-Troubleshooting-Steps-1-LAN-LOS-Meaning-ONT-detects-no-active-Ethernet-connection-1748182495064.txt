Fiber Alarms and Troubleshooting Steps
1. LAN LOS
Meaning: ONT detects no active Ethernet connection on LAN port(s).
Troubleshooting Steps:

Ensure Ethernet cable from ONT to router/device is securely plugged in.

Replace Ethernet cable to rule out cable fault.

Power-cycle ONT/router if connections are secure.

Verify connected device/router is powered and active.

2. Loss of PHY Layer
Meaning: ONT lost optical connection (no detectable incoming signal).
Troubleshooting Steps:

Verify physical fiber cable connections at ONT and wall jack.

Check fiber line for visible damage (cuts, sharp bends, kinks).

Clean or reseat fiber connector gently.

Confirm no recent construction or landscaping near fiber drop.

Dispatch technician if optical levels remain out of spec (typically lower than -27 dBm).

3. Upstream Signal Degradation
Meaning: ONTâ€™s upstream signal quality has degraded, causing errors or speed drops.
Troubleshooting Steps:

Check optical signal levels in Altiplano (-10 dBm to -25 dBm ideal range).

Verify gap between OLT Rx and ONT Tx is within 4 dBm.

Inspect and clean ONT fiber connector.

Verify no excessive fiber length or unnecessary splices.

Dispatch technician if upstream power is consistently unstable or outside range.

4. ONT Reboot due to Firmware/Software
Meaning: ONT restarted automatically after firmware update or due to firmware issues.
Troubleshooting Steps:

Confirm current ONT firmware version via Altiplano.

Check recent logs for recurring firmware update failures.

Power-cycle ONT manually to stabilize firmware if recent update.

Escalate persistent reboots due to firmware/software issues to Tier 2.

5. Dying Gasp
Meaning: ONT lost power and sent "last gasp" notification before shutdown.
Troubleshooting Steps:

Confirm if customer experienced power outage or surge recently.

Verify ONT power adapter is firmly connected.

Check if outlet powering ONT is functioning correctly.

Suggest customer connect ONT to reliable power source or battery backup (UPS) if outages frequent.

6. High Optical RX Power
Meaning: ONT receiving excessively strong optical signal (> -8 dBm).
Troubleshooting Steps:

Confirm correct splitter configuration (check for incorrect splitter ratio).

Consider adding optical attenuator if signal strength remains excessively high.

Dispatch technician if signal remains persistently high to prevent ONT damage.

7. Low Optical RX Power
Meaning: ONT receiving weak optical signal (< -27 dBm), causing intermittent or slow connection.
Troubleshooting Steps:

Inspect fiber connection for dirt, damage, or loose connectors.

Verify splitter configuration and cable integrity.

Schedule dispatch for fiber integrity check if issue persists beyond basic inspection.

Selected Alarm: Loss of PHY Layer
Meaning: ONT lost optical connection (no incoming optical signal).
Troubleshooting Steps:

Verify physical fiber cable connections at ONT and wall jack.

Inspect fiber cable visually for cuts or bends.

Clean or reseat fiber connector carefully.

Confirm no nearby construction affecting fiber.

Dispatch technician if optical levels remain abnormal (below -27 dBm).

This structured approach educates your agents clearly on alarm meanings and practical steps, reducing escalations by enabling informed troubleshooting at Tier 1.
